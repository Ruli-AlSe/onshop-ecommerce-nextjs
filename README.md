E-commerce created using NextJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, Tailwind, Zustand and Stripe. This will be like the template for a real online store but I will be implementing and testing new technologies in here before using them in the real project

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project and install dependencies, I'm using PNPM for this.

2. Create `.env` file based in `.env.template` and fill the variables

3. Create local DB using docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
